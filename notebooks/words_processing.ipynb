    "The typography embodies the mystical, gothic, and enchanted aesthetic of the Harry Potter universe, inspired by ancient spellbooks, wizarding school inscriptions, and magical artifacts. The font is ornate, slightly elongated, and gothic-styled, with sharp, lightning-like serifs, flowing curves, and an old-world, medieval charm. Some letters may have wand-like extensions, flickering edges, or a subtle distressed texture, enhancing the magical, spellbinding effect.\n",

Each word is outlined individually with a glowing, mystical aura or a soft golden shimmer, adding a spell-casting presence. Subtle floating sparkles, swirling mist, or lightning-inspired accents may enhance the typography, giving it the feel of a legendary incantation.\n",
